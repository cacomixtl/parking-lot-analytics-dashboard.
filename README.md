# parking-lot-analytics-dashboard.
A PowerBI project simulating car parking monitoring using synthetic data generated with Python. The dashboard tracks cars entering and exiting a parking lot, calculates dwell times, monitors parking lot utilization, and ensures entry/exit compliance using license plate recognition.

# Overview
This project simulates a car parking monitoring system designed to track cars entering and exiting a parking lot using license plate recognition. The purpose of the project is to create a PowerBI dashboard that provides valuable insights into car movements, including dwell times, entry/exit sequences, and overall parking lot utilization.

The system logs each car's license plate, records its direction (IN or OUT), and calculates various metrics using PowerBI's data modeling capabilities and DAX formulas.

# Project Objectives
Simulate car parking data using Python.
Clean and preprocess the data using Excel.
Create a PowerBI dashboard with interactive visuals and calculated metrics.

# Features
Data Simulation: Synthetic data generated with Python to simulate car entries and exits.
Data Cleaning: Performed in Excel to ensure data consistency.
Dashboard Visuals:
Total Cars Entered/Exited
Average Dwell Time
Current Cars in the Parking Lot
Historical Trends and Car Movements

# Data Details
The dataset includes the following fields:

License Plate: Unique identifier for each car.
Timestamp: Date and time of each event.
Direction: Indicates whether a car entered ("IN") or exited ("OUT").

# Key Metrics
Dwell Time: Time spent in the parking lot between entry and exit.
Car Count: Real-time and historical counts of cars in the parking lot.
Entry/Exit Sequence Compliance: Ensures that cars exit only after entering.

# Future Improvements
Real-time data integration with an edge computing device.
Enhanced car movement prediction models.
Integration of additional data sources for advanced analytics.

# About Me
I am passionate about data analysis, computer vision, and data-driven decision-making. This project demonstrates my skills in data simulation, cleaning, and visualization using Python, Excel, and PowerBI.
